# Redmine Tags

[![Tests](../../workflows/Test/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/test.yml)~~~~

Allows marking up different models in Redmine with tags.
Inspired by original `redmine_tags` of Eric Davis.

## Important news
**This plugin is EOL** and all my efforts will be pointed to move the current features to the Redmine core. Please see http://www.redmine.org/issues/1448 for more details or to track the progress. I will continue to accept/implement only bug fixes and future Redmine versions.

## Supported models

- Issues
- Wiki pages


## Requirements

- Ruby `>= 2.3.8`

that use the `acts-as-taggable-on` gem. Do not run the below command if you have
another active plugin using them.
